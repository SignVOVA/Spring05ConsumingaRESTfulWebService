This guide walks you through the process of creating an application that consumes a RESTful web service.

== What you'll build

You'll build an application that uses Spring's `RestTemplate` to retrieve a random Spring Boot quotation at http://gturnquist-quoters.cfapps.io/api/random.

== Fetch a REST resource

With project setup complete, you can create a simple application that consumes a RESTful service.

A RESTful service has been stood up at http://gturnquist-quoters.cfapps.io/api/random. It randomly fetches quotes about Spring Boot and returns them as a JSON document.

If you request that URL through your web browser or curl, you'll receive a JSON document that looks something like this:

[source,javascript]
----
{
   type: "success",
   value: {
      id: 10,
      quote: "Really loving Spring Boot, makes stand alone Spring apps easy."
   }
}
----

Easy enough, but not terribly useful when fetched through a browser or through curl.

A more useful way to consume a REST web service is programmatically. To help you with that task, Spring provides a convenient template class called {RestTemplate}[`RestTemplate`]. `RestTemplate` makes interacting with most RESTful services a one-line incantation. And it can even bind that data to custom domain types.

First, create a domain class to contain the data that you need. If all you need to know are Pivotal's name, phone number, website URL, and what the pivotalsoftware page is about, then the following domain class should do fine:

`src/main/java/hello/Quote.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Quote.java[]
----

As you can see, this is a simple Java class with a handful of properties and matching getter methods. It's annotated with `@JsonIgnoreProperties` from the Jackson JSON processing library to indicate that any properties not bound in this type should be ignored.

An additional class is needed to embed the inner quotation itself.

`src/main/java/hello/Value.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Value.java[]
----

This uses the same annotations but simply maps onto other data fields. 

== Make the application executable

Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional link:/understanding/WAR[WAR] file for deployment to an external application server, the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application. You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java `main()` method. Along the way, you use Spring's support for embedding the link:/understanding/Tomcat[Tomcat] servlet container as the HTTP runtime, instead of deploying to an external instance.

Now you can write the `Application` class that uses `RestTemplate` to fetch the data from our Spring Boot quotation service.

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

Because the Jackson JSON processing library is in the classpath, `RestTemplate` will use it (via a {HttpMessageConverter}[message converter]) to convert the incoming JSON data into a `Quote` object. From there, the contents of the `Quote` object will be logged to the console.

Here you've only used `RestTemplate` to make an HTTP `GET` request. But `RestTemplate` also supports other HTTP verbs such as `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]


You should see the following output:

....
2015-09-23 14:22:26.415  INFO 23613 --- [main] hello.Application  : Quote{type='success', value=Value{id=12, quote='@springboot with @springframework is pure productivity! Who said in #java one has to write double the code than in other langs? #newFavLib'}}
....

== Summary
Congratulations! You have just developed a simple REST client using Spring.
